# github-webhooks
Web service that listens for organization events to know when a repository has been created. When the repository is created please automate the protection of the master branch. Notify yourself with an @mention in an issue within the repository that outlines the protections that were added.

You can run the webhooks in docker, see https://github.com/jaybpaid/github-webhooks, or you can run the server directly from Github, instructions are at the end of the readme.

#### The following rules are enforced

##### Repository
* Allow merge commits
* Squash commits are not allowed

##### Master Branch
* Pull requests are required to merge to master
* Do not allow re-writting history
* Restrictions are applied to administrators


##### Configuration
You can change the configuration for the settings used by the webhooks.  Each config file is a JSON as described by the references.

---

# To run the webhooks with default settings

## First create a file .webhook_properties with one property defined

```
githubToken=<github api token>
```

## Start docker

``` 
docker run --rm -ti -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD/.webhook_properties:/usr/src/app/.webhook_properties \
	--name github-webhooks jimzucker/github-webhooks:latest
```

## Example docker-compose

You change the parameters for the webhooks by creating a local copy over overriting the config directory

```
version: '3.4'
services:
  github-webhooks:
    image: jimzucker/github-webhooks:latest
    container_name: github-webhooks
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 4567:4567
# you can copy configs locally and then override with:
#  docker cp github-webhooks:/usr/src/app/config .
    volumes:
      - $PWD/webhook_properties:/usr/src/app/.webhook_properties
#      - $PWD/config:/usr/src/app/config
```
